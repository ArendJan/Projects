Find the hackster.io project on https://www.hackster.io/RaspberryPiNerd/arduino-and-android-39b9ee?ref=user&ref_id=29006&offset=0
The code for that project is in the arduinoWiFi folder
The example project is in the ArduinoVoltMeterAndroid folder
I forgot to create the Arduino code(for the Arduino, linkIt ONE) for the arduinoWiFi project, but you can look into the example project and edit the arduino code to what you want.
